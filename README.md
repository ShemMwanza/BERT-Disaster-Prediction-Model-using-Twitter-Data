# BERT-Disaster-Prediction-Model-using-Twitter-Data

Disaster occurrences in Kenya have been a norm over the years, from landslides and floods to
violence and spreading of diseases. These disasters have caused a dent in the economy and
uncertainties in the country and its people. Through Twitter, disaster information can be
captured in real-time, and this information can be vital to first responders in making rescue
plans and creating situational awareness for better disaster management. Therefore, Twitter can
be used to create a way for prediction of disasters.

This project aims to provide a way of predicting disasters through use of Twitter data. The goal
is to develop a model that will be able to predict disasters occurring using Twitter data. This
model will be based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT).
BERT has a bidirectional nature that allows it to understand meaning of words based on context
in any direction of the sequence of the words.

The methodology that will be used in this project will be the Agile development methodology
with scrum approach as it will allow the project to be divided into several sprints that will be
manageable and understandable. The project will follow the OOAD design paradigm that will
allow viewing of the whole project from the point of objects as they function and interact.
